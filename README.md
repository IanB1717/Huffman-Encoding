# Huffman-Encoding
Code used when using Huffman Encoding in relation to Data Structures and algorithms in Java
1)AsciiCodeEncoder will take in a string of any length and will then tell you how many times each ascii charachter was used in the string if
the space beside a number is the output is blank this means it has read a space, it will also then turn the charachter into its ascii
decimal value and will then turn that decimal value to binary and print both of these to the screen.
